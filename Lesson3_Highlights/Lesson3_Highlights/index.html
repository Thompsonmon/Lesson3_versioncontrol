            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control was one of the very first concepts introduced to us when dealing with the whole git system. Version control is just what it sounds like. It allows you to gradually make changes to files so that as time progresses you can go back to a later version of that file if necessary. This interested me because being a web designer we are always having to go back and fix different parts of the programming language. So, if one day I was doing a project for class and the program does something that I didn’t want it to do after I just made my most recent changes, I can go back to my earlier version which can essentially be a life saver</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Its more to just version control than what meets the eye, there is always different types of version control systems as well. These systems act a as tools to help you not make the mistake of writing to the wrong files in the directory, sending them places that they don’t need to be. The VCS and RCS works as a filter and helps to keep the different files apart so you won’t make that mistake. This is helpful for this course because I’m sure that me or any of my class mates will forget what directory we’re in and write to the wrong files, by having this those mistakes will be eliminated.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another key aspect of version control is the Centralized Version Control Systems, which is when systems like subversion, and perforce allows you to collaborate with other users on certain documents and files. In this course, I know we might need to collaborate and work with one another on projects, so in the event that we do, this will give us the chance to. Or if we ever get confused about who’s doing what and what needs to be done in the group, this will allow us to see what’s been done and who did it, and what needs to be finished.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control Systems such as Git is a system that allows clients to go further than looking at snapshots of the files, it lets you look at it exactly, like a mirror image. This would definitely be helpful in the course, if say for instance the server dies, then the client who can see your files can essentially back up the file from their end, since that’s technically what cloning the file will do. This would be very helpful in the course if the server was to ever die and our professor had access to those files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In my earlier classes I learned how to use html coding, and although we use some of the same techniques and steps git is a bit different. The commands for git are definitely different from what I’m used to. There are basic git commands like (commit, pull, and push). Git commit means to put your changes in your local repository, git push means that it records the changes to the repository, and git pull means that exactly what it says to pul or fetch from the repository. This essential to my course because we will be using these commands for the rest of the semester.</p>
